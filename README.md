### ずるい

Fast Linux focused chat application with anime waifus :D

### Why Qml?

`NATIVE` rendering, and not some electron packaged chrome browser disguising itself as application, `NATIVE` rendering xD. Awesome Linux support, 1 more time `NATIVE` rendering ^_^.

`PERFORMANCE`, native compatibility, `PERFORMANCE` ^_^. "Amazing" build tools.

### Why? 

No specific reasons, except:

1. Discord sucks on Linux
2. I can stream shit on discord on Linux (Desktop client with wayland)
3. Discord UI is f**ing slow
4. Discord has no anime waifus
5. Discord has shit customization
6. I just want my own app ^_^
7. `PERFORMANCE`
8. We'll be able stream in 4k@144 fps :D
9. No data collection
10. Anime waifus xD
11. Build your own "Linux distro from scratch"* "Chat distro from scratch"
12. Blazingly fasst
13. No more ideas for now xD

### Which OS will be supported ?

- [X] Linux
- [ ] MacOs (Need to get a Mac)
